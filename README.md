For my final front-end web development project, I created a UX portfolio coded entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS. 
This project showcases my ability to design and develop a responsive and visually appealing website that highlights my design work and technical skills.

The portfolio includes carefully selected images and fonts to align with a cohesive visual theme, enhancing the overall user experience. 
I paid close attention to styling and layout, using custom CSS to craft unique design elements, implement hover effects, and ensure proper spacing and alignment throughout the site. 
Additionally, I incorporated flexbox and other modern CSS techniques to create a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly across devices.

This project demonstrates my understanding of web design principles, my ability to translate a vision into clean, functional code, and my focus on crafting user-centered designs.
